The original dataset has 947 features and 131,076 observations. We classify the features broadly as features from previous history, current crime, from the person (demographics), guidelines of sentence, movements during incaceration, and features describing behavior after release.

```

###THIS SECTION OF CODE WAS CREATED BY ONE OF MY SYSTEMS TEAMMATES 
In many cases if there were not prior charges, the feature AgeFirstArrest was missing. Then, we imputed it with the age of the offender, modifying 1400 cases. With this, we only have 11 missing cases.
```{r}
red<-red %>%
  mutate(AgeFirstArrest = ifelse(totalpriorcharges==0,floor(dofage),AgeFirstArrest) #imputing missing data on AgeFirstArrest
        )
```

##ADDED BY EILEEN -- A BIT MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD THAN THE WAY WE WERE DOING IT IN OUR SYSTEMS CODE
Because there are some dob entered incorrectly in the system, there are some offenders who have a date of offense age that is negative or less than 18 (907). Dropping these cases. 
```{r}
#table(as.integer(red$dofage))
#table(red$dofage<18)
red<- red %>%
  filter(is.na(dofage) | (dofage >= 18 & dofage <= 90)) 
         
```

###THIS SECTION OF CODE WAS CREATED BY ONE OF MY SYSTEMS TEAMMATES 
###I ADDED THE CEILING AT 90 BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT AGES ABOVE THAT ARE VALID
RAP sheets data on juvenile records is not accurate, so we put the minimum age of first arrest on 18. This modifies 21747 cases. 16661 of those cases were 15 or older. 41 were negative and 45 were zero. Since these individuals likely had some juvenile crimes, but this just isn't likely a full record, we think a base of 18 is reasonable. It is more likely that there are now some over 18 for age of first crime that should be set to 18 but had missing juvenile records. Since we only have a date for the first crime in their record, there is nothing we can do about this. 
```{r}
red<-red %>%
  mutate(AgeFirstArrest18 = ifelse(AgeFirstArrest<18,18,
                                   ifelse(AgeFirstArrest>90,90,
                                          AgeFirstArrest))) 

#table(red$AgeFirstArrest18)                                  
```

###THIS SECTION OF CODE WAS CREATED BY ONE OF MY SYSTEMS TEAMMATES BUT EDITED BY EP
Additionally, we created new variables related to the length of criminal career, total convictions and number of crimes per year.
```{r}
red <- red %>%
  mutate(age_difference = dofage - AgeFirstArrest18, #lenght of criminal career (as an adult)
         tot_conv = rowSums(select(., contains("PRSCONV"))), #total convictions
         age_diff_sq = age_difference^2, #criminal career squared
         age_diff_aux = ifelse(age_difference<1,1,age_difference),
         rate_offense = totalpriorcharges_adult/age_diff_aux  #number of offenses per year of criminal careeer
         ) 

```

###THIS SECTION OF CODE WAS CREATED BY ONE OF MY SYSTEMS TEAMMATES BUT EP ADDED ALL THE DRUG AND WEAPON VARIABLES
Transforming characters into classes (factor)
```{r}
#drug -- MAKE NA EQUAL TO 0 BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO RECORD IT MEANS THERE WAS NO DRuG INVOLVED
red$drug[is.na(red$drug)] <- "None"


red<- red %>%
  transform(OFF_SEX = as.factor(OFF_SEX),
            drug = as.factor(drug), 
            POSSESSED_USED = as.factor(POSSESSED_USED), 
            ENHANCEMENT_WEAPONS = as.factor(ENHANCEMENT_WEAPONS)
        )
```

###THIS SECTION OF CODE WAS CREATED BY ONE OF MY SYSTEMS TEAMMATES 
###THERE ARE FEWER OF THESE SINCE I DROPPED THE NEGATIVE OFFENSE AGES AND WE CAPPED AGE AT FIRST AT 18 BUT SINCE THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CLEARLY ERRONEOUSLY OLD AT DOFAGE AND AGEFIRSTARREST THERE ARE STILL SOME NEGATIVES
Also, we filtered cases with age difference negative (we keep cases until -1, to avoid problems of age coding integer versus continuous) and 3 cases with age difference greater than 75. We end with 129727 cases
```{r}
#table(red$dofage>red$AgeFirstArrest18)
#table(as.integer(red$dofage))
#table(as.integer(red$AgeFirstArrest18))

red<- red %>%
  filter(is.na(age_difference) | (age_difference >= -1 & age_difference <= 75) #to avoid problems of continuous vs integer ages
         ) 

nrow(red)
```

####NEW EP DATA CLEANING/CHECKING -- FROM THIS POINT FORWARD THIS IS ALL ORIGINAL CODE
Since this ML project is about the type of first arrest, I want to make sure the first arrest data looks okay. 
```{r}
#50655 do not recidivate
table(red$totalchargesfirstarrest, exclude = NULL)

#Examine the variables -- determine which are unique and which are different versions of the same
first <- grep("^firstburglaryt$", colnames(red)) #230
#last <- grep("^firstPublicOrdert$", colnames(red)) #245
#last <- grep("^firstkidnappingt$", colnames(red)) #249
#last <- grep("^firstviolent_middlet$", colnames(red)) #267
last <- grep("^firstabscondt$", colnames(red)) #247
red <- red %>%
  mutate(first_sum = Reduce("+",.[first:last])) #total charges first arrest should match var of same name


table(red$totalchargesfirstarrest==red$first_sum)
#table(red$firstmurdert[red$firstPersonalFt==0 & red$firstPersonalMt==0])
#NOTE: MURDER IS INCLUDED IN firstPErsonalFt BUT SHOULD BE CODED INTO ITS OWN CATEGORY BECAUSE IT IS WORSE THAN AN F
#Need to take murders out of firstPErsonalFt
red$firstPersonalFt <- red$firstPersonalFt - red$firstmurdert
red <- red %>%
  mutate(first_sum = Reduce("+",.[first:last]) + firstmurdert) #total charges first arrest should match var of same name
table(red$totalchargesfirstarrest==red$first_sum)

#For the future crime (variables with "first" in the name), I know the type to crime (burglary, kidnapping, etc) but not the grade (Non-graded, Misdemeanor, Felony, Murder). In order to determine the grade, I am examining the civil code, and where it is not clear, I am looking at the matching variables on crime type for the current crime (for which I do have grade information) to determine what grade each category should be. In most cases this assignment was based on 97% or more (one was 80%). Since people often commit more than one crime in each arrest, I will take the most serious crime. 

#This is to determine how to code the "first" variables which match up to these variables. My assumption is that beaucause these are determined by law if the current burglaries are all felonies (or almost all) then felonies in the next crime variable will also be felonies
#find variable indices
first <- grep("^burglary$", colnames(red))
